# machineLearning_musicAnalysis

The focus of this work is the application of machine learning techniques in music analysis, with a specific case study on the work KÃ¼rze Schatten II, by composer Brian Ferneyhough (1990). An analysis of Ferneyhough's scores by traditional analytical methods is challenging, due to the complexity of the notation and the composer's characteristic organizational processes. The musical figures vary continuously, making it difficult to classify them and, consequently, to analyze their position in the temporal flow. In this sense, the use of machine learning techniques offers a promising opportunity for analysis, allowing automatic segmentation of the score and classification of segments into a reduced number of categories, based on musical similarities. The formalization of the analysis in the Python programming language will serve as the backbone of this process, allowing a systematic and replicable approach. The analytical approach involved transcribing the score from the published version, converting it to midi format, and then creating a table with some data extracted directly from the midi file and with other information derived from it (time distances between attacks, pitch intervals, etc.). The proposal can be defined as a computational analysis of this table, combining automatic statistical procedures with choices and directions of the analyst's personal listening/interpretation.
